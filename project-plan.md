# Game Show Program - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Medieval-themed game show application with score tracking and spinning wheel for desktop/laptop computers. Two versions developed:

1. **V1 (Flask/HTML)** - Complete, production-ready
2. **V2 (Next.js/React)** - Modern frontend with TypeScript

## Technology Approach ✅

**V1:** Flask + HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Complete and stable
**V2:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript - Modern architecture

Both versions share core functionality but V2 provides better developer experience and maintainability.

## Current Status

### V1 (Flask/HTML) ✅ COMPLETE
- Fully functional game show application
- Medieval fantasy theme with animations  
- Score tracking for 3 players
- Interactive spinning wheel
- Keyboard shortcuts (F1/F2, Space/Enter)
- Ready for production use

### V2 (Next.js/React) ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- Modern React architecture with TypeScript
- All core components built (ScoreBoard, PlayerCard, SpinningWheel)
- localStorage persistence  
- Medieval theme maintained
- Pure frontend (no backend required)

## Quick Setup

### V1 (Flask)
```bash
cd game-show
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### V2 (Next.js) 
```bash
cd gameshow-app
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Future Development

### Potential Enhancements
- **Enhanced Animations**: Add Framer Motion for smoother effects
- **Custom Themes**: Additional visual themes beyond medieval
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for spins and score changes
- **Network Play**: Multi-device support for larger groups
- **Tournament Mode**: Bracket-style competition support

### Distribution Options
- **Electron**: Desktop app packaging
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment  
- **Static Export**: Fully client-side V2 deployment
